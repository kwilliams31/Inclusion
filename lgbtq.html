  <h4 id="gay">LGBTQIA+</h4>
    <p>
      To begin, the acronym LGBTQIA+ stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (questioning), intersex, asexual/agender. There are a multitude of terms encompassed within this acronym and the community is not limited to these. 
      
      How can I support this community? Ways can include but not limited to:
      <ol>
        <li> Listening and learning: Taking the time to do these things can mean so much more than you think. Asking how you can help and listening to their advice is an easy step to help create a better relationship. Education is a big part of being an ally and it is not anyones responsibilty but your own. </li>
        <li> Be kind: You don't have to agree with their choices, but you can always be kind. </li>
        
          
  </ol>
      Knowing what words/questions can be harmful:

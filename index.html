    <h4 id="inclusion">Inclusion</h4>
    <p> Inclusion is the actions taken to creating a diverse community. Being inclusive means allowing equal opportunities, providing resources to marginalized groups. (Wiki)
      
      Ways to be more inclusive:
      <ol>
        <li> Using appropriate and respectful language </li>
        <li> Be aware of your unconscious mind: There can be many reasons why a person has underlying opinions. This can be caused by upbringing, geographic location, etc. Being aware of unconscious thoughts help you become more aware. ex. unconscious bias </li>
  </ol>
  
  Why is it important to be inclusive?
  <br>
  Creating a diverse group comes from the actions of being inclusive. Many people who are apart of marginalized groups just want to accepted and not seen as someone who does not have the same rights as others. It is important to know your own privilege when it comes ot helping these groups. Understanding why these groups feel this way and using your power can help so much.
  <br>
  Allowing these groups to have representation in any context.

  How do I become more inclusive in my everyday life?
  How do I make sure everyone feels included?
